Each folder contains the discriminating instances found for each model. 

Each instance will have a folder containing: input files for the two solvers, the terminal output of AutoIG that includes the commands used to invoke the solvers, the generator instance parameters, and the instance parameter file.

There is a cvs file per model that lists the instances and the time taken for each solver to solve the instance.
